                About Warka leather products
            </h5>
            <p>
                   Warka Products is a luxury leather brand rooted in Ethiopia, where ancient craftsmanship meets contemporary design. 
                Named after the Warka tree, known for its towering height and deep roots in Ethiopian culture, the brand symbolizes strength, 
                longevity, and heritage. Each product is carefully crafted by artisans who have honed their skills for generations, using locally sourced, 
                sustainable leather that tells the story of Ethiopia's rich history.<br>

                   Each Warka product is not merely an accessory; it is a testament to the art of traditional leatherworking that has been passed down through 
                generations. Our skilled artisans, who come from families with decades of experience in leather crafting, work tirelessly to create products that 
                are not only functional but also luxurious in both texture and finish. These artisans use techniques that date back centuries, blending age-old methods 
                with modern innovation to bring you bags, wallets, belts, and accessories that are truly one-of-a-kind.<br>

                   The leather used in every product is sourced from Ethiopia's finest tanneries, where sustainable practices are a top priority. We are committed to using 
                ethically produced, locally sourced leather, ensuring that every piece reflects the country's values of sustainability, community, and respect for the 
                environment. Our materials are handpicked for their natural beauty and unique grain, each mark and imperfection telling the story of the cow's life, 
                making every item a unique work of art.<br>
            </p>
